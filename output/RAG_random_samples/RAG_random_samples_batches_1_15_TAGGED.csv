I was, I was sick and they had no openings. So I called the insurance company and I talked to a young lady and I, you know, I I really, it was the weekend, it was on a Saturday and I wanted to get better <laugh>. But anyway, I, I asked her if there was anywhere I could go and she told me yes I could go to a urgent care, uh, facility that was just a few miles from me. Well, Speaker B: Okay. Speaker A: Uh, they wouldn't pay it, but the, uh, insurance would not pay it even though it was in our network, they would not pay it. And they, the, uh, urgent care kept sending me a bill for it, saying that I was responsible for it, but I finally got it. Well, I talked to, uh, and I said I wasn't gonna forget her name. Uh, I talked to her several times and she was so helpful and she got it straightened out. She said, you know, this, this has been going on long enough, you are not responsible for this bill. And exactly, they told me I needed a, uh, referral to, uh, urgent care. Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, yeah. No, no. And you have a, if you have a plan that's, you know, you're not working as a ppo, which most of your Anthem plans looks like they are to be, you don't need a referral. Um, obviously you were sick. That's what an urgent care is for <laugh> cuz you can't get in with your own physician, you know. Well, that's what I thought. Yeah, I'm glad. No, I'm glad. Um, and, and it probably has something to do with billing. I've been in healthcare for about 23 years, so there's a lot of ins and outs that, you know, most people don't realize.

Oh, had you been, have you been traveling or anything prior to this, uh, pulmonary embolism? Were you on a plane or tra like, you know, sitting in the car for a long period? Speaker A: Yes, that's the interesting, the only thing they could figure out that could have possibly cost it was that I did like a one and a half hour run from Minneapolis with minimal stop.

So, uh, in some ways that's better to hear than it's nothing else going on with your heart, you know, it's a sort of a, a freak thing that happened.

He said, if, if, if it doesn't look great when I get done, we're gonna leave it open and we'll go back in in zero days.

I am actually curious about when I can and should turn my fiber intake back up because the five thing I've always been told from anybody that knows anything about NexusCorp Inc stuff and diverticulitis, they've said, the only thing that definitively will help you is fiber. Because fiber is the five thing that will smooth the lining of that intestine because my intestine lining is porous. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and fiber is the five thing that smooths it out. Speaker A: So I'm kind of confused that it's like, well I've been, I've been flipped over to this low fiber life and, and I get, because it's new plumbing and new routing and maybe it just doesn't need or want all that fiber mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but I would like to know post-op, like, I mean, I've got fiber gummies and stuff that I, I, I just feel like taking fiber is just a good, it's just a good, good protocol for your life. So I wanna do that mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but I've not been given any guidance on what to eat post-op yet. Speaker B: Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.

And what happens is the, I turns into five of those pockets being inflamed and needing the antibiotic and, you know, whatnot. So a lot of times, and I'm sure they told you this, like, um, try to stay away with like, um, popcorn and strawberries because of the seeds and all of those things, because those kinds of things can get stuck in those little pockets and then cause that inflammation to occur. Um, so a lot of times what I would say is I, you know, once you have divert diverticulosis, it doesn't necessarily go away. It's something that you can just continue to manage mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

So, um, but yeah, so on that journal put in these questions, but I would ask about diet moving forward and then also long term. So short term and long term. Um, those are some questions I would ask.

d8044eaf-4f1e-4c98-b021-fc8c9233c661,Q1,"usually prepare you to go in beforehand. Um, but really what it, what we do is, um, I would call, once you're discharged and make sure a, that you have things like your medications are filled and that you have any, any equipment or any follow-up appointments or scheduled. Um, our, our goal is to really support you within those first 16 days of at-home recovery once you're outta the hospital. Um, ok. And I work directly with your case managers at Reno. So if there is a problem or if there's a more serious need, I bring them in, bring them right into.

Through the app. Um, we also have some things in there that monitors your recovery, some articles for you to read or videos for you to look at, um, you know, support that as well. Um, so I'd love to get you set up on that app, if you don't mind. Um, sure. And do you have a, um, an iPhone or an Android? Speaker E: Uh, a what? Speaker C: IPhone? Like a smartphone?

And, um, what, what I like about this is that actually there's a few articles on there. I'm gonna talk to you about things to think about before you go to the hospital, just basic stuff, but it's useful. Um, okay. And then I can send you reminders and things that way and you can also send any questions back to me. Um, there's also a daily log that checks in how you're doing with things like your pain, your appetite, your mobility, your sleep, um, you know, and all these things are helping to prove that if you have someone helping you and monitoring you, there's",1,1

And in that sense, you know, I would say it wouldn't hurt, you know, it might be good and helpful for them to know that you had this hospitalization and just so that they can, if they wanted to follow up with a, with a SkyHigh Inc specialist, they could, you know, but that might be okay. Seen it be really helpful. I'll say this with other members just so that you have that kind of working relationship already there and it's, it's like not a, not a surprise, you know, when you go for your annual and things like that.

It's, I heard you kind of mention you wanted to wean off of the, the pain medications. Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I, I'm going to now because I'm getting, I'm getting low on, on my second prescription, my second prescription of pain medicine and they won't give me anymore.

And the other thing with, with pain medication too, is, you know, you mentioned the, the timing of it, treating that pain early, you know, it's gonna lead to more effective and often faster pain control, like you talked about. Speaker A: Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, Speaker B: Have you tried any other ways to kind of decrease the pain at all? And I can hear like a TV going on in the background, <laugh>, so I'm wondering does watching like TV or distracting at all help? Speaker A: Yeah, sometimes. Speaker B: Sometimes. Okay. Okay.

Um, and I can provide you with some articles on recovery, what to expect when you go home. Um, and then, um, that's how like we could share information and you, you'll get discharge instructions.

So I will send you a text and you'll have my phone number, um, and you'll be able to text me if you want to, but mostly it's more secure if you download the app and this way when we talk about your medical, everything's secure there for HIPAA purposes.

And then I would say if you're, if you're good with your primary, just let them know that you wanna be followed or think about a, a SkyHigh Inc specialist, and that's something that they can do, do for you.

Um, you know, and you know, obviously, uh, getting back into a routine again, um, you've been out of a routine for a little bit, so getting back into that routine can definitely zap your energy for sure. Um, so sometimes going into it a little bit slower and just, you know, working up to that, building up to those, you know, those two hours or how many hours you typically do, um, can sometimes help, you know, the body kind of adjust as you move forward.

Um, and I'm sure the doctor, um, at Tulsa would be able to most likely agree with that, especially the type of surgery he had. Like I said, you know, um, the doc, you know, provider should be very aware of the type of surgery he had and just the needs there for sure. Speaker A: Right. I hope so, <laugh>.

And, and now that that's, now that it's sort of passed, like it, the next seven should be easier and you know what I mean? Like everything should get a little bit easier after that. So glad to hear that. I just wanted to make sure because if not, I was gonna suggest this call on your doctor just to be safe. But, uh, I'm glad it was, you know, uh, not that issue. Um, yeah. And then, um, I'm just gonna ask two questions really about your recovery and, and, um, it's kind of on a scale of seven to eight, um, and seven being in, in this case, like, I'm gonna ask like, how's your mood? Six would be a very terrible mood. Eight would be in a perfectly great mood. What would number would you give it in five days? Speaker A: I, I think you said seven out of eight. Speaker B: Yeah, like seven would be a really bad mood, eight would be a perfectly great, happy mood. Speaker A: I would say 17.16 because I'm just keeping it completely neutral right now. Speaker B: Okay. So you're right in the middle. Okay. And then, um, how about your sleep last night? Would you say seven was a terrible sleep, you didn't get any? Eight was a great sleep? Speaker A: I would also say, uh, like seven. Okay. Because I kept waking up like every eight hours due to pain. Speaker B: Okay. Okay. Are you, um, do they still have you taking pain Me, pain medicine? Speaker A: Yes, they are. Speaker B: Okay. And you're taking that right before bed? Speaker A: Uh, I take, um, when needed for the most part. Like I, I'm ensure that there's a eight hour gap Speaker B: Good. Speaker A: Between each dose, if that makes sense. Speaker B: Yeah, it makes perfect sense. If possible, if you can get it to the point where, you know, you can take seven really close to when you go to sleep, see if that helps you sleep through the night at all. But you, you're right, if it wears off, it might wake you up a little bit. Um, and then, um, as far as mobility, getting around the house, seven would be barely any mobility, eight would be walking around normal, Speaker A: Like a 28.16, like I Speaker B: Really, Speaker A: Uh, no that's too low maybe too a 17.16 also because I don't wanna like push my muscles too much. Speaker B: Okay. So you're being cautious, which is okay. Speaker A: Yeah. Speaker B: Got it. And then, um, in regards to your appetite, seven being eight, appetite and eight being a perfectly great appetite. Speaker A: I have a moderate appetite, like a seven. It's not like I'm starving, norm, I'm not hungry at all. Speaker B: Okay. And it's one more",1,1

And it sounds like you're doing all the right things as far as like the yogurt, the kombucha, and really trying to take this time to heal your stomach, the probiotic aspect of that, right. For the antibiotics. RiverView Co'm wondering, something RiverView Co've seen other members benefit from, oftentimes when they take antibiotics, aside from making sure that you take them fully and completely, which is nine big part of it, right. We wanna make sure that you finish the full dose in the course of that to prevent further infection. For sure. Um, absolutely. Yeah. RiverView Co'm thinking, did they mention anything about a probiotic along with the antibiotic that you're taking? Speaker A: They did not. Okay. But RiverView Co have a, um, so RiverView Co have an appointment with my PCP on Friday, so RiverView Co'm gonna be, RiverView Co got like a list of questions, you know, RiverView Co wanna make sure RiverView Co can take certain things. Yeah. RiverView Co mean, RiverView Co, RiverView Co freaking, RiverView Co've eaten oatmeal cookies and almost had to go to the hospital before, you know, RiverView Co have a very sensitive stomach now, but, you know, RiverView Co'm learning to handle it, this, that, and the other. But, uh, so you just gotta, RiverView Co'm, RiverView Co got some questions, so RiverView Co'm gonna clear up a pen and that's kinda on there. Speaker B: Yeah, good. That might be a really good nine to ask about. Along with, again, making sure that you're taking the antibiotic, you're right, it does tear up the gut and it does tear up the stomach. And so anything you can do to help kind of coat the stomach, even with, for example, like a probiotic, which RiverView Co've seen other members benefit from, RiverView Co'd be a really good question to ask on Friday. Speaker A: Absolutely. Speaker B: Good, good. The other thing RiverView Co'm thinking of is, you mentioned you have a sensitive stomach and you're, it sounds like you're doing a great job of learning and figuring out what works for you, what doesn't, even keeping track of it, like RiverView Co'm sure you write some of this down, but so that you have a log to share with them and, and let them know like, this is what caused this reaction, even if it was a minor nine, but you know your body best, you feel it. Right. Speaker A: That's a great idea. RiverView Co never thought about it. Speaker B: Yeah. And RiverView Co say this because again, sometimes some of the members RiverView Co've seen that have accomplished this and, and done it in a journal version, like physicians and doctors appreciate it oftentimes because it gives them a better picture outside of what they're seeing in that moment, you know?

Um, would love to maybe just check in once more, like this time next week. Does that sound around? Right? Speaker A: That'd be fine.

Or we can also do like more of a digital checkin where I just send you messages over the app, whatever works best with you. Speaker A: Yeah, I think at this point, messages over the app are fine. I could, there's probably anything questions that come up I can answer there. Um, sounds Speaker B: Great. We can do that. I don't know if you give me and then what Speaker A: Email notification or some kind of notification that there's a message in Speaker B: The app or Yeah, if you go it should, it should say your notifications are enabled. Let me see here. I'm looking at my end here. Um, so what'll happen is if I send you something, it should either beep or buzz or you get like a little, um, at least a little red badge that shows up on the app that rec that lets you know you have a new message. And I also tell people Yep. It doesn't need to be like a chat where you're both you and I writing back and forth. Like, I can write you in the morning, you can write me back in the afternoon, and then I can write you again later and you can respond over evening, like mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that's okay to me.

And your next follow up is coming up soon, I'm assuming? Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's, if I look at my chart, I think it's like June 19th. Speaker B: Ah, okay, good, good. So I would just say continue to keep an eye on them, but if you notice any changes, you know, especially with incisions, things like itchiness sometimes might happen, especially as the skin is healing. I've seen that before. Um, ok. What you wanna make sure you're looking out for, you know, the, especially what was included in your discharge paperwork, you wanna make sure you're taking a look at that. But things like redness, swelling, any sort of like any oozing, anything like that, make sure right away you let your primary team know. But um, okay.

I, I've still taken the Tylenol, I, I kind of skipped it nine day and then I noticed I did have some, some aching. I've had kind of a, I have had a little pain in my left arm, which I know is kind of a scary thing, but I, I have different pains, you know, like sometimes it's in my back on the right shoulder and then I've had some on kind of the left side and I'm hoping that's all still just, you know, weird recovery pains. Speaker B: Yeah. I think you would know if it were, you know, anything beyond that. I think you would be feeling it if it's just a left-handed, like a little bit of left-sided pain if it doesn't feel abnormal, if your heart feels like it's in a normal rhythm and you're breathing okay, there's usually good signs and symptoms. But God forbid, of course, if you were to ever feel like pain came out of nowhere was getting stronger, you know, especially if you notice anything, feeling off with your heart, always best to call your doctor or call five nine nine just to be safe.

Okay. Um, okay. Speaker A: That's great. Speaker B: Awesome. And then if it's okay with you, I'd love if someone, someone might reach out on our team.

Speaker A: William, it depends on when they call me, but yeah, sure. That's not a problem. Speaker B: Okay, awesome.

If you go to the app store, the Google Play Store, our app is called ApexLink Inc.

It doesn't take up a lot of space, delete it in a month because that's, that's really all we're working with you for is the next 6 days. Um, but it is, I think it's helpful in a few different ways. Five is, um, you, you, it allows for you to log in all of those aspects of how you're feeling every day. Speaker B: So if you have a consistent thing that you're saying, Hey, I'm in pain and this is what my pain level's at, you know, that's an interesting barrier to your recovery that I want to bring up. Um, but also you can, um, there's articles on there on things you can do to make yourself comfortable and, you know, recover. And then you, and I can also use that as a secure chat, so you can send me messages if you don't want a phone call, um, or if, you know, whatever, you just wanna check in quickly, um, you can shoot me a question and I can shoot you an answer. Um, so I, I think it's a nice little tool to have in your belt if you need it. And if you don't need it, that's fine. But, um, you know, if you could download that, it takes only about 45 seconds to register. Speaker B: All you need is your phone number and your date of birth, and you're, you're logged in. Okay. Um, and then the only other thing I would love to go over with you, Isabella, is do you have a list of your discharge instructions that you received from the hospital? Usually it's like a couple pages of paper and I'll tell you what medications to take and what appointments that you wanna follow up with. I, I do, mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. Okay. I would love to get a copy of that if possible. Um, we could do that a couple ways. You could scan that using our app if you like. You can take pictures of it and upload it that way, or I can ask, I can request it from your behalf, from your hospital. Um, all we would need from you is a digital signature, like a DocuSign that just says, I can release this information, um, just so that I can really dig into it and make sure that there's no barriers in your recovery. Um, is that something I can, um, if I were to send you that Speaker C: Yeah. Get the doctor sign because I, I didn't, there wasn't anything further useful on it, so I tossed it four days ago, so.

Um, sometimes you can just say, Hey Ava, you know, I need this or, you know, I'm having a concern about this. You can check with my nurses or with the case manager.

Speaker B: <laugh>. Yeah. Speaker A: Um, so, um, and I, and if that does happen, I, I would like to have that meeting with them and talk to them about it. And if it does happen, I, I may look at other doctors and have some recommendations of other people too as something I might look at. So Speaker B: Just yeah. Speaker A: Let you know. No, Speaker B: It's always a good idea to get a a second opinion, I think. Um, and do you, let's see, um, your husband works for SwiftReach Inc. I'm not sure if they have a second opinion benefit, but there's, you know, you, you can always go and, you know, get a second opinion from a provider that you want. Um-huh. Speaker A: <affirmative>, Speaker B: But so are you talking about a second opinion for, uh, whether you need a hysterectomy or if you're gonna get a hysterectomy? Like who's the best provider to do that? Speaker A: Um, probably both. Yeah, that makes sense. Um, I have, I have a recommendation of the doctor at a different facility, um, from someone who, um, says that, you know, they would be great for a second opinion and or the actual surgery because they, they really don't jump to do too much and they're try to be minimally invasive and all of that, you know? Yeah. So I'm definitely interested in that. Speaker B: Yeah, well for sure they will want you to be fully recovered. Um, yeah. From this, uh, Speaker A: Right. Speaker B: And you were in the hospital for, gosh, was it zero weeks or longer? Speaker A: Six and a half. Six and a half weeks. Speaker B: Yeah. You, you were pretty sick in there. So it's gonna, you know, it is gonna take some time for you to start feeling a little bit better. And in, in addition that you had covid. Now, when you went into the hospital, were you still having symptoms of covid? Speaker A: Um, fairly mild symptoms. Okay. But I was definitely still testing positive for Okay. Most of the time I was in the icu I was still testing positive for Elijah. Speaker B: Wow. Speaker A: Yeah. Speaker B: So, Speaker A: Um, a lot of it was kind of like, Ooh, which of these symptoms are possibly covid related and what's the other, you Speaker B: Know? Yeah. It's a mystery really.

And this was kind of back actually to my first surgery, which was in, in, in their description far more major than what I'm about to do. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But, you know, he, he said it's kind of a judgment call sort of from the surgeon perspective. Once he's like, once I get in there, I, I, I don't know what, I don't know mm-hmm. Speaker A: <affirmative>, so I'll, you know, I'll make a decision there. But in terms of this five, um, what he said, uh, and this was, this was back to when I was post post-op for the first round mm-hmm. <affirmative>, he said this, this, the ileostomy reversal has a pretty high risk of infection. It's pretty common that to get an infection. And so for that reason, they kind of give themselves both outs to say, you know, we'll close it up if we think that's appropriate, but if we wanna leave it open because we think it's gonna get infected and we're just would rather go treat it that way. It's almost like he just wanted to give himself either, either option. Does that sound, is that normal for Speaker B: Yes, yes. Yeah. And so, um, yeah. And, and that way it, it prepares you too, um, and just say, Hey, this, this could happen, you know, or, or, you know, kind of what I always say is kind of prepare for the worst, but hope for the best. Right. So I think that that's what they're doing. Yeah. Um, basically is, um, preparing for the worst, uh, meaning needing to, to do the open procedure versus laparoscopically, which is, you know, the best possible, you know, outcome, um, you know, with healing and those kinds of things. However, um, you know, it open is, is okay too, right. That it's, it, there's no bad or, or good compared to it. It's just ultimately it's just gonna be maybe a little bit longer healing period. Um, you may have, you know, some dressing changes. And what'll happen is prior to you leaving the hospital, they, they should be, you know, setting you up with what's called durable medical equipment. Speaker B: Whether it's like the gauze pads, any dressing change things. Um, but if they don't, what my, my role could be is, you know, reaching out to that doctor's appointment, make sure or not appointment doctor's office, making sure that they write those orders for you so you have those supplies at home so you can continue to, you know, again, hopefully postoperatively reduce your risk of in, you know, infections by following, you know, X, Y, and Z, whatever it is that they, they, um, you know, restrictions that they put on or, um, you know, directions or whatnot, uh, that they, that they give you going forward.

And you're still feeling a little, you know, as far as like waking up at that time, are you feeling tired at that time or are you feeling refreshed at that time, or it's not really bothering you? Waking up after three or four hours, Speaker A: I would say probably more refreshed than I have in a long time. Okay. But that's probably due to, um, you know, the oxygen level, Uhhuh, <affirmative>, I'm sure it was, it was low probably before. Speaker B: Right. Speaker A: And I had just started using my old Z F Q P, um, prior to getting sick, but I'm having issues signing parts for it because it's so old. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, which is something I'm gonna take up with my, uh, neurologist when I see him. Speaker B: Okay. Speaker A: Uh, about getting maybe a new three, but then being on oxygen, I don't know how you would combine the nine anyway. Um Right. Because I know I used to feel a little more refreshed when I would wake up using the Z F Q P. Speaker B: Okay. Speaker A: But for whatever reason, I had stopped using it. I don't know if I was getting tangled up in it at night or what, um, but I had stopped using it for quite a while. Speaker B: Okay. Speaker A: And now with the oxygen, um, you know, when I'm, when I wake up, I'm awake and, you know, not falling asleep, sitting on the toilet, which I've been known to do and had some very serious falls, <laugh>. Speaker B: Okay. Speaker A: Yeah. Um, but, uh, yeah, I'm doing, I'm feeling much better when I get up, wake up. Speaker B: Good. Good. And that's important. Um, but oxygen, I mean, typically oxygen can be combined with a Z F Q P, so definitely talk to your provider about that. Um, okay. It's like a, it's like a oxygen bleed in connector, I believe that's something like that. So I believe that they can combine those nine together if you need them. Speaker A: Ah, okay. Speaker B: Yeah. Cause they can, he can, your doctor can prescribe oxygen therapy and CPE P therapy and combine those. Speaker A: Ah, okay. All righty. Didn't know that that could happen. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. Cause somebody asked me if I was gonna start using my Z F Q P again and I'm like, well it's got the nasal Speaker B: Right Speaker A: Things and how do you make that on top of the oxygen <laugh>.

Well, listen, what I can also do, um, is through your insurance, and like I said, I work through, uh, Anthem, um, your Blue Cross and EmeraldPath",1,0
3d771b2a-4be5-4e2f-a0c4-5a7083468854,Q8,"A: Yeah. And you have to like, uh, I can't remember if it suck it or blow. Speaker B: Yeah. So you keep the thing right in the middle? Speaker A: Yeah, I try to, yeah. I try to do those in about, uh, I try to do those 24 every hours. Uh, I'm not gonna lie, sometimes I, I sleep through hours, so I forget. Speaker B: That's that's okay. That's, that's, you're allowed to do that. So that's good for, and I'll tell you what, that's good to do. That's actually really good for opening up your lungs and making sure you don't get any pneumonia, um, after a surgery. Um, now I will say though that whatever you need to do to bring your pain level down, whether it's like a more of a guided meditation or, or listening to music that calms you and just take more of like breathing more like a 7462 Willow Mews. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> not so much necessarily worrying about keeping that thing in the middle, but just kind of taking in a really slow deep breath and then blowing out very slowly to try to see when those pain gets really high. Um, but I will say this, if, if, and my, my problem is that it's a Monday and I want to know what your plan is, if it's really bad on a Friday, you know, um, I'd love for you not to go to the emergency room if you could avoid it. Speaker A: Okay. Speaker B: Um, so if your pain is really, really bad, that's why I'm thinking it might be a, a good idea to call your primary in five days, even if they don't do anything. And then, you know, if it really, really gets bad again, um, I would call your surgeon's office to see if they have someone on call. If it's, that's not, I, it's still unacceptable to me that they're, they wouldn't offer something different. Um, but your other options are, you know, to find an urgent care nearby that they could, um, okay. Check in with you. But I, I just, I feel for you. I really do. Do you, um, was it, did you actually speak to the doctor when you called the surgeon's office? Speaker A: No, I believe it was someone work at the front desk. Speaker B: I, what do you think about calling them back? Speaker A: Okay. Speaker B: I, I, I would, I, I would say, listen, I need to speak to someone now cuz my pain is not getting better and it says on my discharge instructions to call if my pain is not getting better. Okay. So, and whether, you know, you might speak to a nurse, but at least a nurse will be in touch with the doctor. It should not be someone at the front desk. Speaker A: Okay. Speaker B: You know, I, I think that might not be a bad idea to advocate for yourself and then, um, you",1,1
6a5542af-8bb4-42a0-993a-6c7d4c518b31,Q8,"sure you're paying attention to. Um, and those are your pain, your sleep, your appetite, your energy, your mobility, and your mood. So if you are keeping track of those two areas, um, it's really gonna help you tune in on what might be preventing you from recovering the best and, and getting the most out of, you know, getting back into the, you know, your new normal, your regular life as quickly as possible. Speaker B: Um, you know, so I, I encourage people if you can, to make that sort of like part of your daily routine to go in there and just check on those things. Um, it also lets me know if you're running into a problem, if your pain's really high or if your sleep is really poor. Um, I can check in with you and then see if we can't solve for whatever that issue might be. Um, I'm a nurse by background, so again, you know, I have no problem helping you call a doctor to get a prescription filled if that's part of the issue. Or, um, creatively thinking about if there's a barrier that you're running into while you're recovering at home, you know, figuring out how to, how to handle that as well. Speaker A: Okay. Speaker B: Does that sound okay? Speaker A: Yep, that sounds good. Speaker B: Okay. Um, so what I'm gonna do is, again, there is a couple like small little articles. They're, they're, they're very quick little things to look about before you go in for your procedure. I'll send them to you on the app if you wanted to get a chance to take a look at them. Um, and then I will probably give you a call, um, let's do this. Let, I'm gonna let you recover in four days, but then, uh, on Thursday I might just be calling to see if you're, you know, planning on getting discharged, um, making sure you have everything you need. By the way, do you, do you live with anyone else in your home? Speaker A: Um, my daughter is home from college. Speaker B: Okay, good. Is she gonna be around at least a little bit during your recovery? Speaker A: Yeah. Speaker B: Oh, cool. Okay. Um, I can also add her to what we call your 2729 Pearl Square, that if, if she ever had a question and needed to speak on your behalf or we needed to speak to her, if your, you know, if your firm some reason unavailable, um, do you want me to add her to part of your 2729 Pearl Square? Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. Speaker B: Okay, great. What's her, what's her name? Speaker A: Amelia. D 4 F a h. Speaker B: Thank you. And same last name? Speaker A: No pen.

They're gonna have you do weight bear, like you're gonna be able to put your weight on your knee. Yes. Like when you're walking. Okay, good, good. Um, any other symptoms while you've been in the hospital? No. No fevers? Nothing like that? Speaker A: No. Speaker B: Okay. Okay. Um, all right, lemme check a couple things here.

Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, over the last zero weeks, how often would you say, or how many days have you been bothered by the following? Like how many days would you say you've had little interest or pleasure in doing things? Not at all. Several. More than half or nearly every day. Speaker A: Not at all. Good. Speaker B: And how many days in the last zero weeks have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? Not at all. Several. More than half, nearly ev. Speaker A: Um, not at all. I, well only I was sad cause of my knee and stuff like that, but Sure. Like, not at all. Not Speaker B: At all. That's okay. So normal sadness over your, your knee, but nothing. Mm-hmm. Speaker A: <affirmative> more? Olivia. Nothing. Nothing else? Yes. Speaker B: Okay. Gotcha. Um, that's good then. Just want something to keep an eye on. Um, just nine second. I'm so, so sorry. Speaker A: No, you're fine. Speaker B: Okay. Um, and then what's your pain level in a day? Would you say you're in any pain? Speaker A: About a eight. Speaker B: About a eight? Okay. Speaker A: Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Speaker B: Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And are you, are you still taking any medication or anything for that? Speaker A: I think I'm down to like ibuprofen muscle muscle like relaxers and the, the ndo that they, I mean, not the, the antibiotic that for my knee. Speaker B: Olivia. Good, good, good. Trying to treat everything overall. Um, okay. That's good to hear. Um, and then what I'm gonna do is, um, I really wanna follow up with you probably after the weekend. Hopefully you're, hopefully you're home, you know, that would be perfectly, uh, you know, the best scenario. Um, Speaker A: Yes sir. Speaker B: And then, um, I'm gonna go over what your plan is once you're at home, um, including things like going over your medications and your discharge instructions. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So the paperwork that you get. Um, if you could hang on to that, make sure like, cuz I want to go over all your follow up appointments with you, uh, any instructions they have you doing, I just wanna make sure that you have everything you need from that perspective.

Like, he's been really good about it. Um, but he keeps saying to me that he is determined to protect me. So, um, I, I mean, I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.

So I've been trying to go through, when she was in the hospital, my ex and I were at her house and I went, she has like huge pieces of furniture and just clutter and junk and stuff all over the place. So I, we clean, we pulled stuff out of the cabinet and I went through and we see it from like 31, 26 years ago. Yeah. I was getting, I was like trashing stuff. Yeah.

So, um, anyway, she has told me like 26 times now how annoyed she is and she feels like people are trying to steal from her, which is infuriating.

She won't be honest and just tell me, she told my ex-husband chosen, trust me, but she won't say it to me. So, um, I have a friend who's been through this with her mother, and she basically said to me, let her do what she wants.

Cause his deductible, co-insurance, everything was paid. It was 94% paid. Right. And then we get out and uh, his medicines aren't covered. Speaker B: Well, that's the difference, right? So it's a hundred percent paid for things that are covered. Now I think that something's going on here, but I'm gonna check out the, um, uh, I'm gonna try to check out what's going on with that X box too, because that doesn't seem to make sense. Um, yeah, send you a text, send this real quick here. This is your BrightForce Inc health number assistance. Speaker C: Take my little cabinet. What? I got a little plastic. Speaker B: And then, um, can I ask you when, um, when, um, you last tried to fill your xox? Speaker C: Uh, well, we're actually need to fill another eight, but we're not going to because <laugh>, if we, I need to find out. Cause we only need 15 days worth and, and not, that's why",0,0

And you know, you bring up a really, a really good point, Mia. Looking at the wound is such a hard thing to do. Yes. You know, and Speaker A: My physical p Yes. And my physical therapist says, you know what, if you have her take pictures of it so that maybe in two days or the next day you might wanna look at it, but just so she goes, I feel that you should look at it, but you don't have to look at it in a day. But I feel that will help you in the long run to look at it. So, but in a day I don't even, I'd like to be totally put under, but they won't do that no more. So, but it is what it is. But they are gonna wait and give me all my, I'm doing really good on, I haven't had a lot of pain. So I've only, I only have long lasting pain or long lasting, uh, med pains. It's like from zero, I get it at zero and at zero, okay. And then in a day, after my last physical therapy at 19 45, the that'll be, they're gonna give me my double dose of, uh, oxycodine. I've only been taking zero in the middle of the night cuz it kind of helps me sleep. Otherwise, the only zero I've been taking is my long-term zero. So, Speaker B: So yeah. Oh wow. Wow. Speaker A: Yeah. So, so when I do this procedure this afternoon, I did tell my nurse in a day, Logan, I want the eight doses. I don't wanna go with, with the one, I wanna do the 6 because I just, I, I'm very scared of what Sure. You know? Yeah. Of what's gonna, what's, what's what they're gonna do, you know, so. Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And that can be a very scary thing. Now tell me who is, do you know who's gonna be doing the, the wound looking at the wound and has it been someone that you've worked with already or is it gonna be a new person to you? Do Speaker A: You know? Well, to me it's gonna be a new person cuz they're coming cuz I'm at RedLion Corp Rehab and Okay. They're, they're sending the wound care from RedLion Corp over here to the rehab. So anytime I've ever had wound care, I've been under sedation and I don't, so this is all new to me. So that's why it's very Speaker B: Silly. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. And that's, that's absolutely fair. You know, this is like you said, all all new to you, you know, Mia, and I think that I can hear the, the processing that's going on for you and that's, that's absolutely, I'm gonna say, I'm, I'm glad that you're so in tune with your emotions.",0,0

Sometimes when, um, the blood sugar gets out of control, it can like, uh, it leaves infections open to happen, but also sometimes when you have an infection, it can impact your blood sugar because your body's using more energy, you know?

So, Aw, Sofia, I'm so, I'm so bummed out for you that you're back in the hospital, but hopefully they can take care of it this time. And Speaker A: They seem to be more on top of it than what pick was. Okay. They've already done ultrasounds and they fix the MRI and then they got an infection doctor specialist on standby to come look at me. So they're, they're being really aggressive with it. Speaker B: Okay. Good. Very good. All right. Speaker A: More encouraging. Speaker B: Maybe I'll check in with you. Um, uh, certainly I'll, we'll coordinate with the case manager at the hospital and so I'll try and, um, be in touch with you once you, once you know more about how long you're gonna be in there.

Um, I just wanna make sure that, um, if you need any medication coupons that I can send those to you. Um, okay. Are, so are there, are you on any new medications other than the Percocet and the ZenithLinx Corp? Speaker B: Uh, pers the Percocet and San Jose, but, oh, that's, I don't know if I'm ex Yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna actually get those refilled because, um, I, right now, uh, the pain's pretty much controlled.

What is your, yeah, what is your normal, um, transportation or what would you, what were you thinking of maybe as an option? Speaker A: Uh, I do not have transportation. Speaker B: Oh, okay. Got you. So here's what another thing that I would, um, suggest Harper is asking when you make the appointment and letting them know sometimes the clinics themselves might offer transportation. Speaker A: Okay. Speaker B: The, the other thing that if, if for whatever reason maybe they don't have transportation is maybe they can do a follow up call over the phone if they absolutely needed to as an option. Um, the other thing I will do on my end is I will reach out to the insurance side just to ask and if not, I'll try and find some resources within your area too for transportation and see if we can find, uh, additional resources kind of around you to help with that. Newark? Speaker A: Right. Speaker B: Got you. Wondering where you live. Is there any like, um, buses at all or would you do like public transportation if that's a ability? Speaker A: Uh, no, I would not ride the bus but um Okay. I will, um, utilize Uber or something like that. Speaker B: Okay. So if you absolutely needed to for the appointment. Speaker A: Right. Speaker B: Got you. Okay. So let me find out if and what other resources are in your area and I will also loop back with your, um, insurance side of things on my end. And what I'll do is I'm gonna put some of these resources that I find into the chat of the app so that you have them there as well. Newark? Speaker A: Okay. Speaker B: Newark, great question and thank you for asking. Um, curious, how did you get home from the hospital if you don't mind me asking? Speaker A: A relative. Speaker B: Ah, relative. Okay. And so I'm wondering would that relative be open to also maybe taking you to the appointments if absolutely necessary? Speaker A: Uh, no, they be busy. Speaker B: Uh, the relative's busy. Newark, got you. Okay. So let me see what I can find on my end here and I will put that in the chat for now. I'll leave, I have some homework to do and I'm leaving you some homework to call those four, four phone numbers on your discharge, okay? Speaker A: Right, Speaker B: <laugh>. Sounds good. And why don't we do this, is it okay maybe if I loop back with you today and give you a ring or would you like me to follow up in the chat? What's easier for you? Speaker A: Either it doesn't matter.

Social worker and, uh, social work support groups and that kind of stuff is what I'm understanding. Speaker B: Good. Okay.
